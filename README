Store passwords? I'm not sure

INSTALL

Start by importing the MySQL.
Then make the /keys directory writable by the PHP CLI user
Run ./generateUser Username Password (make sure it's chmod'd +x)
Manually insert the given Username and Password into the database (the ID doesn't matter)
Navigate to /html in your browser, and log in with the username and password you gave.

Encryption and Decryption works atm

TODO: Generate a one time use session decryption key when users log in, destroy it on log out
